(The Smart Way)","description":"Welcome to your first step into the exciting world of building AI applications! If you\'ve ever been curious about how AI works or how to build your own, you\'re in the right place. We\'re going to build an AI-powered textbook, and we\'ll do it using a powerful technique called Spec-Driven Development.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapter-2":{"id":"chapter-2","title":"Chapter 2: Docusaurus Setup & Markdown Basics","description":"Welcome to Chapter 2! In this chapter, we\'ll get our hands dirty and set up the foundation for our AI textbook. We\'ll install Docusaurus, a fantastic tool for building websites like this one, and then we\'ll learn the basics of Markdown, the language you\'ll use to write your content.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapter-3":{"id":"chapter-3","title":"Chapter 3: Writing Your First Spec with Spec-Kit Plus","description":"In Chapter 1, we introduced the idea of \\"Spec-Driven Development\\"\u2014creating a blueprint for our software before we build it. Now, it\'s time to learn how to draw that blueprint. In this chapter, we\'ll dive into the \\"spec-first\\" methodology and use a tool called Spec-Kit Plus to write our very first specification.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapter-4":{"id":"chapter-4","title":"Chapter 4: Building the RAG Chatbot","description":"In the previous chapter, we meticulously crafted a specification for our GeminiModel client. Now, it\'s time to put that blueprint into action and build the core of our intelligent application: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot. This chapter will guide you through the architecture and implementation of a chatbot that can answer questions based on a specific set of documents.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapter-5":{"id":"chapter-5","title":"Chapter 5: User Authentication and Personalization","description":"Our RAG chatbot is architecturally sound, but it\'s impersonal. Every user gets the same experience. To create a truly engaging application, we need to know who our users are. This chapter will cover how to add user authentication to our FastAPI backend and how to use that identity to create a personalized user experience.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapter-6":{"id":"chapter-6","title":"Chapter 6: Urdu Translation and Multilingual Content","description":"Our application is growing in features, but what about its audience? To reach a global community, supporting multiple languages is essential. In this chapter, we\'ll explore how to make our Docusaurus book available in both English and Urdu, and how Docusaurus provides a seamless way for users to toggle between languages.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapter-7":{"id":"chapter-7","title":"Chapter 7: Integration and Deployment","description":"We\'ve come a long way. We\'ve written specifications, designed architectures, and authored several chapters of our book. Now it\'s time to bring everything together, review our work, and share it with the world. This chapter will cover the final steps: integrating our content and deploying our Docusaurus site to GitHub Pages.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapter-8":{"id":"chapter-8","title":"Chapter 8: Advanced Features and Subagents","description":"So far, our application has been built around a single, powerful AI model. But what happens when a task becomes too complex for a single line of thought? To build truly advanced applications, we need to move from a monolithic mindset to a modular one, employing a team of specialized \\"subagents\\" that work together. This chapter introduces the concept of reusable intelligence and showcases how to design a system of collaborating subagents.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chapter-9":{"id":"chapter-9","title":"Chapter 9: Final Thoughts and Next Steps","description":"We\'ve reached the end of our journey through building an AI-powered application with a spec-first approach. From the initial vision to deploying a multilingual, intelligent system, you\'ve gained practical insights into modern AI development. This final chapter summarizes our key learnings, offers practical tips for your own projects, and looks ahead to the exciting future of AI.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
